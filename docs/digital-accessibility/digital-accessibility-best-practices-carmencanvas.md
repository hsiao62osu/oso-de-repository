# Best Practices in Digital Accessibility - CarmenCanvas

To confirm the accessibility of your work in CarmenCanvas, use the [Rich Content Editor (RCE) accessibility checker](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/improve-accessibility-carmen-rich/using-canvas-accessibility-checker) (via TLRC).

Here are how the best practices apply:
- Set the title and language of a document: 
	- Make sure that each page, assignment, quiz, and discussion have a descriptive title
- [Use headings to structure document content](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/improve-accessibility-carmen-rich/accessible-headings-rce) (via TLRC)
- [Use built-in lists ](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/improve-accessibility-carmen-rich/create-accessible-lists-rce) (via TLRC)
- [Write descriptive links](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/improve-accessibility-rich-content/create-accessible-descriptive-links) (via TLRC)
- [Use built-in tables](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/improve-accessibility-carmen-rich/building-accessible-tables-rce) (via TLRC)
- [Provide text alternatives for images and figures](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/improve-accessibility-carmen-rich/add-alternative-text-images-using) (via TLRC)
- [Provide text alternatives for math and scientific notations](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/carmencanvas/guides/carmen-integrations/wiris) (via TLRC)
- Place elements of a document in an order they are meant to be read: 
	- In general, what you see on screen is how a screen reader will read the document. 
	- One exception is a floating image, which allows an image to visually exist at a location different from where it was inserted. As a general best practice, text wrapping is not recommended
