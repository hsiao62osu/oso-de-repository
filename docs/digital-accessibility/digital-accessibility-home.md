# OLI Digital Accessibility Overview for IDs, LXDs, and SAs

**Note:** These resources were last updated for WCAG 2.1. 

Creating accessible content means reaching the widest possible audience regardless of limitations or disabilities, whether physical, sensory, or cognitive. Always think critically about how you are asking an end-user to interact with your project to make sure you being inclusive. Designing with accessibility in mind will save you time from remediating.

Here are a few examples:
- **Visual**: This includes blindness, color blindness and low vision. When building accessible content consider how you communicate information for a user that may not be able to access the visuals on the screen.
- **Auditory**: This includes users who are deaf or hard of hearing and may require additional content through captioning.
- **Motor**: This includes users who may have limited mobility and navigate the internet using a keyboard or mouth stick.
- **Cognitive**: This includes people who require additional context to understand the content.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) published new regulations addressing digital accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that will go into effect on April 24, 2026. The revised rule mandates that all web content and mobile apps (digital content) must be readily accessible upfront and comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Levels A and AA (WCAG 2.1). Ohio State's Minimum Digital Accessibility Standards are based on WCAG. 

Learn more the new Title II rules on the OSU Digital Accessibility Services page, "[Digital Accessibility: Title II and You](https://das.osu.edu/digital-accessibility-title-ii-and-you)".
