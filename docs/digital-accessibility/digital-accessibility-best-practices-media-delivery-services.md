# Best Practices in Digital Accessibility - Media Delivery Services

Here are the three media delivery services that you may encounter as part of your work:
* Mediasite (Enterprise-approved)
* Echo 360 (Medicine and associated programs ONLY)
* Panopto (Nursing ONLY)

Ohio State Online supports enterprise-approved solutions. For instructor questions related to Echo 360 and Panopto, refer them to respective local support individuals/units. 

Echo 360 and Panopto provides automated caption AND downloadable transcript by default, accessible via their respective media viewers. 

Mediasite provides automated caption by default for newly-uploaded videos:
* For videos without captions, see [Captioning Your Presentation](https://teaching.resources.osu.edu/toolsets/mediasite/guides/managing-your-presentation/captioning-your-presentation) (via TLRC). **Note:** The automated captions for videos produced internally by Ohio State Online (e.g., professionally-produced instructor bio and course intro) must be edited for accuracy.
* To link to a downloadable transcript, first follow the steps on [Download transcripts](https://docs.mediasite.com/mymediasite/index.html#!Documents/downloadtranscripts.htm) (via Mediasite Docs).
