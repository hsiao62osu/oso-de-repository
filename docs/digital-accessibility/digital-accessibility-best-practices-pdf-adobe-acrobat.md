# Best Practices in Digital Accessibility - PDF/Adobe Acrobat

A good way to ensure PDF accessibility is making sure the source document (e.g., Word) is accessible from the get go. 

Here are some additional best practices:
* [Set the title and language of a document](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html) (via Adobe, see the "Title" and "Document Language" sections)
* Provide text alternatives for images and figures:
	* [Figures Alternate Text](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html) (via Adobe) 
	* [Mark images and figures as decorative/artifact](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2017/07/25/accessible-pdfs-in-acrobat-dc-tagging-content-as-an-artifact) (via Adobe)
* [Use built-in tables](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/editing-document-structure-content-tags.html) (via Adobe, see "Correct table tags with the Tags panel")
* Place elements of a document in an order they are meant to be read: 
	* [Preserve document structure by converting to PDF using the Acrobat add-in for Microsoft 365](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/converting#pdfmaker) (via WebAIM)
	* [Run Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on documents initially scanned as images](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/scan-documents-pdf.html) (via Adobe see “Recognize text in scanned documents”)
	* [Ensure document elements are tagged](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat#tags) (via WebAIM)
	* [Ensure document has reading order structure](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat#order) (via WebAIM. Acrobat can be finicky with adjustments, which may also affect accuracy of tags)
	* [Run accessibility checker](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/acrobat#accessibilityTools) and [remediate accessibility issues](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/reviewing) (via WebAIM)
* [Form fields must be named, labeled, and placed in an order they are meant to be completed](https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/forms) (via WebAIM)
