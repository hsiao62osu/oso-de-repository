# Training Organization

Before you start going through the training, first familiarize yourself with how the modules are set up and decide how you want to engage with them.

Here are the modules in this training:

- **Module 1: Just the Basics**
	- In this module, you will first learn about some of the building blocks of web, namely HTML and CSS. You will also learn about what a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) editor is, as well as Carmen’s version of it, the Rich Content Editor (RCE). Should you need them, there are optional resources in this module to help you familiarize yourself with the RCE.
- **Module 2: HTML – Text, Basic Formatting, and Containers**
    - In this module, you will first learn about what HTML elements look like – this will help you recognize them and start differentiating different elements. Then, you will learn about the HTML elements that you can use to structuring an webpage, including headers, paragraphs, and containers. You will also learn about some HTML elements that you can use to format your web content, including bold, italic, underline, line breaks, and horizontal lines.
- **Module 3: HTML – Multimedia**
    - In this module, you will first learn what HTML attributes are – specifically, you will learn some common ways to supply metadata, or information, to HTML elements that determine what they show, how they look like, or how they behave. Then, you will learn about what digital accessibility is, why does it matter, and how your use of HTML elements can enhance (or hurt) digital accessibility. You will also learn about HTML elements that you can use to display multimedia – images embedded webpages.
- **Module 4: HTML – Semantics**

    - In this module, you will first learn about what a CSS declaration looks like; in other words, how do you write the CSS to make something look the way you want it to. Then, you will learn about the common units that you will encounter when working with CSS – lengths and colors. You will also learn some CSS properties for formatting text.
- **Module 6: CSS – The Box Model** 
    - In this module, you will learn about the CSS Box Model, which will help you style containers in your web content so they look the way you want. Then, you will learn about what “cascading” means in “Cascading Stylesheet”, which will also be helpful with styling containers.
