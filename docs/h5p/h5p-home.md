# H5P

H5P is a tool in the OSO toolset for creating standard interactive objects. H5P objects can be added to a Carmen course as links or as embeds.

Please refer to H5P.org’s official documentations for their [authoring guide and examples](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications). In OSO H5P, you can also access them by selecting your account name at the top right, “Getting started”, then “Authoring Guide”.

There are two instances of H5P:
- **OSO H5P**, which is where you should start _development_; and
- **Local H5P**, which is for _hosting_ H5P objects used in courses offered by select colleges

Consult with the LXD team to see if H5P is right for your project and to request a license for OSO H5P (if available).

When creating H5P objects, you should budget extra time for its review and approval process – other than the typical faculty approval, your objects need additional digital accessibility approval from the responsible instructional designer(s), affiliate(s), or digital accessibility liaison(s) / coordinator(s). 

## What are H5P, H5P.org, and H5P.com?

H5P is an open-source authoring platform for interactive object that can be linked to or embedded, for example, on a Carmen page.

H5P.org is a showcase site for H5P that supports limited exploration, and it is not ideal for hosting mission-critical (course) objects.

H5P.com, on the other hand, is a paid, hosted version of H5P. Different groups and organizations can have their own H5P.com instances. OTDI has purchased a few H5P.com licenses to share amongst instructional designers, instructional technologists, and other stakeholders across the organization.

OSO’s H5P.com instance can be accessed via [https://otdi.h5p.com](https://otdi.h5p.com). _(Referred thereafter as “OSO H5P”)_

## Why are there two instances of H5P.com at OSU?

A group of colleges purchased an instance of H5P.com for local usage. It is hosted at [https://osu.h5p.com](https://osu.h5p.com). _(Referred thereafter as “Local H5P”)_

OSO has purchased our own H5P.com licenses, which is intended for creation and hosting of H5P objects created for Ohio State Online (OSO) courses and projects. It is hosted at [https://otdi.h5p.com](https://otdi.h5p.com).

**Here are some rules of thumb:**
- Create your H5P objects in OSO H5P.
- If an H5P object is used in a course from a college that participates in Local H5P, the object should ultimately be hosted on Local H5P.
    - Local H5P’s digital accessibility guidelines, such as disallowed content types, should be followed in addition to OSO’s. 
    - You will need to request / work with someone with a Local H5P license to transfer the object.

## How is content organized in OSO H5P?

Each user has their own **My Content** area, which houses the H5P objects and folders that they have created.

There is also a **Shared with me** area, where H5P objects and folders that have been shared with you are listed.

In addition, there are two organization-level folders (“Organization Folder”) created by the OSO H5P admin:

- **Course Projects**, which contains folders created by program
- **Non-Course Projects**, which contains folders created by project

When you share an object with an organization folder, you are actually sharing a reference link rather than the object itself. Deleting said object will remove the organization folder’s reference to it. You can share an object with multiple organization folders.

## Who has access to my content in OSO H5P?

You can edit and manage the objects that you create. You can add collaborators to the folders and objects that you create to give them edit access.

All OSO H5P users can view and clone objects that have been shared with an organization folder; a personal folder cannot be shared with an organization folder.
