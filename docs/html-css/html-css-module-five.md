# Module 5: CSS – Common Units and Text Formatting

In this module, you will first learn about what a CSS declaration looks like; in other words, how do you write the CSS to make something look the way you want it to. Then, you will learn about the common units that you will encounter when working with CSS – lengths and colors. You will also learn some CSS properties for formatting text.

## Learning Outcomes

In this module, our content and activities will help you to be able to do the following:

- Create a CSS declaration
- Describe common CSS length units, including pixel (`px`) and relative size to parent (`em`, `%`)

- Describe common CSS properties for text formatting, including text alignment (`text-align`), font size (`font-size`), font weight (`font-weight`), font (`font-family`), text color `(color),` and background color (`background-color`)
