# Who has access to my Panopto sessions?

By default, a session has the same permissions (i.e., who can view, who can manage) as the folder it lives in. For example:
- Only you have Creator access (i.e., view and manage) to your personal **My Folder**; thus, by default, any session that lives under this folder is accessible by you and you only. In addition, you can create subfolders under **My Folder** and customize their permissions.
- When using the Panopto integration (LTI) for Carmen, a special Panopto folder managed by the LTI is created for each CarmenCanvas course. Videos uploaded to this folder are automatically made available (i.e., permissions given) to the course’s roster

Permissions can be further modified on a case-by-case basis.

Here are some common sharing scenarios:
* Collaborate on a folder or a session with specific persons at OSU
* Embed a session in a Carmen course via the Panopto integration for CarmenCanvas
* Link or embed a session on a page (including in a Carmen course) accessible by anyone (at OSU)

**Note**: While you have the ability to list your session on the **Everything** portal page in Panopto, which is accessible by anyone at OSU, it is not a relevant scenario for the vast majority of users.
