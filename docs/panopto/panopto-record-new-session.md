# Record a New Session for Panopto

Panopto provides two recording options for your work and personal machines:

- [Panopto Capture](https://support.panopto.com/s/article/How-to-Create-a-Video-Using-Panopto-Capture), which is available on desktop and mobile browsers without needing to install additional software (**Note:** iOS support was “coming soon” at the time of writing)
- [Panopto for Windows](https://support.panopto.com/s/article/basic-recording-1) or [Panopto for Mac](https://support.panopto.com/s/article/Recording-with-Panopto-for-Mac), which needs to be installed on your device (**Note:** for managed devices, consult with your local IT support)

Either option is great for recording audio, video, an application, and/or your desktop. We think Panopto Capture should suffice for most use cases.

Here is how to record a new session to Panopto using Panopto Capture.

## Record using Panopto Capture

To record a new session using Panopto Capture:
1. From the Panopto website, click the **+ Create** button at the top left, then click **Panopto Capture**; a new tab or window will open _(Alternatively, from the Panopto Video page in a Carmen course, click the **+ Create** button at the top)._ Depending on your system and browser, you may be asked to give Panopto Capture permission to use your microphone(s) and camera(s), as well as to record your desktop; such prompts typically takes the form of a popup

	    1. **Tip**: Before recording, you can hover your mouse over your camera feed, and click the picture-in-picture icon to pop it out so you can preview it while recording (solid rectanble inside a outlined rectangle). Note that if you are also recording your screen, this preview will be included

4. Click the “red circle” record button at the bottom center to start recording, and the “red square” stop button to stop
5. When done, you will have opportunity to edit the session information and/or edit the session itself:
