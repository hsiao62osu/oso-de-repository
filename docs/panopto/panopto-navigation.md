# Navigating in Panopto

## Folder-based navigation

Session organization in Panopto is based on folders; similarly, security permissions of a session (i.e., who can view) is also based on folders by default.

Once logged into Panopto, you can use the left menu to access folders that you have access to:
- **My Folder:** Access your personal folder, which may contain any subfolders that you create
- **Browse**: Access all folders that you have access to; you *may* see the following top-level folders
    - **My Folder** (see above)
    - **CarmenCanvas**, which includes special folders for Carmen course offerings managed by the Panopto integration for Carmen
    - **Users**, which includes folders that have been shared directly with you, including shared folders for OSO courses managed by Digital Learning
    - Other folders that have been generally shared with OSU (i.e., **Your Organization**)

There are some index pages that you may find helpful for viewing purposes:
- The **Subscriptions** page aggregates sessions from folders that you subscribe to
    - You can open folder shared with OSU and subscribe to its contents by clicking its “+ Subscribe” button at the top right of the page
    - You can also subscribe to people and tags
- The **Shared with Me** page aggregates sessions that have been directly shared with you, including those in folders that have been shared with you
- The **Everything** page aggregates the above two categories as well as sessions that have been generally shared with OSU

Panopto does not currently provide a folder bookmarking feature.
